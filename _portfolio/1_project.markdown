The artworks within the installation are made of brass paper fasteners pushed through A4 sheets of pressed paper pulp. The paper fastener is a stationery item used for securing multiple sheets of paper together and may be used in place of staples, but is more commonly used in situations where rotation around the joint is desirable. Due to the age and quality variety of the paper fasteners some have oxidized and become tarnished, showing a black patina. The paper pulp sheets are made and used in the paper making process within paper mills, but are not the final product.
