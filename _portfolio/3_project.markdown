This selection of works is part of a series called 'Out of Pattern'. It started with a small number of gouache on paper paintings that were exhibited in 2006 in Galeria ArtFit in Lisbon, Portugal. The underlying inspirations of the stylized motifs in these works are not always apparent, but they are always based on my personal life and surroundings.
<br/>
This particular series is all about pattern and line; sometimes they look like they dilute each other or renew themselves as a single organism and other times they seem more like two autonomous opponents in conflict, claiming a disticntive pattern for themselves.
